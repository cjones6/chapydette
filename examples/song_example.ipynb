Chapydette provides three options: bag-of-features, VLAD, and Fisher vectors. We'll try bag-of-features. Bag-of-features creates histograms for sliding windows. To do so, it does the following:\n",
    "1. Standardizes the data and runs PCA\n",
    "2. Runs k-means to create a \"codebook\"\n",
    "3. Finds the nearest centroid to each observation\n",
    "4. Forms a sliding window across the observations and creates a histogram within each sliding window based on the results of the previous step\n",

If you want the sliding windows to be based on time rather than index, you need to specify a vector of times, with one time for each observation. For example, for this song we could input the times in the song at which all of the observations were recorded.\n",
